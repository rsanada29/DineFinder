    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following information:</p>
    <p><strong>Account information</strong> &mdash; When you sign up, we collect your email address, display name, and profile photo via Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google Sign-In, or Apple Sign-In).</p>
    <p><strong>Location data</strong> &mdash; Your device location is used to find nearby restaurants. Location is only accessed while the app is in use and is not stored on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Saved restaurants and preferences</strong> &mdash; Your swipe choices, saved restaurants, and filter settings are stored both locally on your device and in Google Firebase Firestore for cloud sync.</p>
    <p><strong>Group data</strong> &mdash; If you create or join a group, your group membership and restaurant swipe choices within that group are stored in Firebase Firestore and shared with other group members.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your location is sent to the Google Places API to fetch nearby restaurant results.</p>
    <p>Your account information is used to identify you within the app and in groups.</p>
    <p>Your saved restaurants and preferences are synced via Firebase Firestore so they persist across devices and sessions.</p>
    <p>Group swipe data is used to calculate restaurant matches between group members.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored in two places:</p>
    <p><strong>Locally on your device</strong> &mdash; Using AsyncStorage for offline access and caching.</p>
    <p><strong>Google Firebase</strong> &mdash; Account data (Firebase Authentication), saved restaurants, user preferences, and group data are stored in Firebase Firestore. Firebase servers are managed by Google and are subject to Google's security practices.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DineFinder uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <p>Google Firebase &mdash; Authentication, data storage (Firestore).<br>
    Google Places API &mdash; Restaurant data, photos, and reviews.<br>
    Apple Sign-In &mdash; Authentication (iOS).</p>
    <p>By using this app, you also agree to the terms and privacy policies of these services:</p>
    <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Terms of Service</a> &middot; <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

    <h2>5. Location Data</h2>
    <p>Location access is requested only while the app is in use ("When In Use" permission). We do not track your location in the background. Your coordinates are sent to the Google Places API to fetch nearby restaurants and are not stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. Your data is only shared in the following cases:</p>
    <p>With other members of groups you join (swipe choices only).</p>
    <p>With Google services (Firebase, Places API) as necessary to provide the app's functionality.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete your saved restaurants and leave groups at any time within the app. You can also delete your account and all associated data from the Account screen (Account &rarr; Delete Account). Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>DineFinder is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated through the app.</p>
