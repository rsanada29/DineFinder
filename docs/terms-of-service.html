    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using DineFinder, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>DineFinder is a restaurant discovery app that allows users to browse, filter, and save nearby restaurants using a swipe-based interface. The app uses your device location to show relevant results. Restaurant data, including photos, reviews, and business details, is sourced from the Google Places API.</p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>You may create an account using email and password, Google Sign-In, or Apple Sign-In. Account data is managed through Google Firebase Authentication. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Groups Feature</h2>
    <p>DineFinder allows users to create or join groups using invite codes. Within a group, your restaurant swipe choices are shared with other group members to find matching restaurants. By joining a group, you consent to sharing your swipe data with the other members of that group.</p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to: (a) use the service for any unlawful purpose; (b) attempt to gain unauthorised access to any part of the service; (c) interfere with or disrupt the service; (d) reproduce or distribute any part of the service without permission.</p>

    <h2>6. Restaurant Information</h2>
    <p>Restaurant data (hours, prices, ratings, reviews, photos) is provided by the Google Places API and may not always be accurate or up to date. DineFinder does not verify this information. Please confirm details directly with the restaurant before visiting.</p>

    <h2>7. Google Terms</h2>
    <p>DineFinder uses Google Maps and Google Places services. By using this app, you also agree to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Terms of Service</a> &middot; <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>DineFinder is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any restaurant information displayed in the app.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer of DineFinder shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app or any restaurant visited based on app information.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
